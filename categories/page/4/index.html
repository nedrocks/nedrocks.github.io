  Clarifying my intentions to myself has been one of the strongest changes I've made over the past few years. I can't say that in every stage and step of life I knew what my end goals are, but I'm getting closer.
The big question people like to ask is &ldquo;where do you see yourself in 5 (or 10 or 15) years?&rdquo; My answer five years ago, like most people in their mid-twenties, was probably lacklackluster.

  Control your perceptions, Direct your actions properly, Willingly accept what's outside your control.
Perception, action, and will are the big three. Clearly with these three statements aligned huge improvements are guaranteed.
For me the furthest from optimal is my ability to control my perceptions. When I feel things going the wrong way for me, my first reaction is people are acting subversively. For instance, when scheduling an appointment with someone's assistant, I constantly second guess any questions they ask or changes they make.

  Today I reflect on saying no. No to new obligations, to invitations, and to exasperation (through saying no to undesired emotions.) Being able to say no, Seneca reasons, allows us to live more of our life the way we desire to live it.
I can't recall the first time I learned about the virtues of saying no. I do remember in 2012 answering a job interview question with the virtues of saying no.

  Epictetus states that only the educated are free. That it’s not enough to say only the free should be educated. Cause and effect — cast off the shackles by learning.
Historically, learning has driven me. Not necessarily learning via an organized process, but understanding a concept down to the basics. Once I feel I understand, once I have forged my ring, I truly own that lesson. Freedom, in my view, is understanding and truly owning all of the lessons.

  Epictetus asks rhetorically where to do we look for good and evil? Within the externals that we have no control over or the choices that we control. Obviously things that we have no control over should not affect our happiness or outlook and yet so often we look at these externals as reflections of who we are, or some outcome of choices that we made. When we missed our connect flight by 2 minutes due to a delay I yelled my head off and acted really salty to the women at the gate, but it had no affect on the situation other than darkening my outlook.
