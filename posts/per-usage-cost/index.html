				<p>I'm always surprised when I realize my $400 suit costs about $20 each wear. Of course I may not live similar to a banker who probably wear a suit 50-100 times before replacement, but most formal engagements require me to spend one suit utilization unit and when I start to iron it the thought crosses my mind.</p>
<p>Bike shorts, cost somewhere around $5 whenever I go for a ride. I bought my golf clubs for a steal at $150 and have played at least 50 rounds of golf for a cost of $3 per round. Our mattress cost $700 and, if I assume 5 years of nightly sleep, costs us $0.39 per night. My shoes that I wear every day cost $100 and will last me about a year giving me a $0.27 per day amortized cost per use.</p>
<p>Bridesmaids probably have it the worst. Unlike groomsmen who can rent matching tuxedoes, they usually have to purchase a $200-$300 gown that they will wear once for a per usage cost of $300.</p>
<p>I have not driven daily in the past five years. When I did, I understood that society requires car ownership (a lease at least) to participate. I never once thought about the cost per use of my car, but thinking about it now it seems rather negative.</p>
<p>Take my Audi lease in 2010-2013. It cost $614 per month plus $100 per month insurance for a total of $714 per month. Over the 36 month lease, I spent $25,704. Assuming I drove the car two times per day, that cost me $11.73 per ride! While not all rides are created equal, this is rather surprising.</p>
<p>This metric of per cost usage seems reasonably useless based on this cursory investigation. I'm still reasonably interested in the thought but not able to make any conclusions.</p>
