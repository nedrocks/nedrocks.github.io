<h3 id="chapter-1-the-truth-about-relativity">Chapter 1: The Truth About Relativity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Objectivity is nearly impossible
<ul>
<li>how much is something actually worth?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People make relative decisions on worth.
<ul>
<li>They like the better of some options but not the best</li>
<li>Think bread makers - when they don't sell because they are new, introduce a second, more expensive bread maker and the cheaper one will sell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-2-the-fallacy-of-supply--demand">Chapter 2: The Fallacy of Supply &amp; Demand</h3>
<ul>
<li>Demand can be manufactured
<ul>
<li>Black pearls made in high demand simply by positioning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anchoring - the first price you hear foro a product or category tends to stick.</li>
<li>Starbucks
<ul>
<li>Positioned itself differently to remove Dunkin Donuts&rsquo; price anchor for coffee (why should I pay $4 for a cup of coffee?)</li>
<li>Once you go a few times, your decision making for going again is akin to seeing a line out the front door (it's clearly popular because I've been.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tom Sawyer showed a low supply product (painting fence) and raised demand.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Zero calories vs. 1 calorie</li>
<li>Paying for dinner
