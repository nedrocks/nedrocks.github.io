				<p>One year ago I made a major career change. I transitioned from an engineering director position managing a team of 18 engineers and three managers to an individual contributor senior engineer.</p>
<p>Honestly I struggled initially while deciding on the transition. It felt like my career would backslide with the change. On one hand I had fought hard and succeeded to reach the director level and I enjoyed my team - in fact I had hired almost half of them myself. On the other hand, my team's charter had run its course and the team struggled from a product perspective to find traction. As such, the majority of my efforts went to managing my team through pivots. Every three to six weeks our team would pivot on metrics and product.</p>
<p>It was difficult because I believe it's not a strongly winnable position[^1]. Obviously management is not a game and there aren't solvable actions, but the idea still applies &ndash; there did not seem to be a winnable solution to the problem because there was no way to do well, only to keep my teams&rsquo; collective heads above water. After nine months of this I had enough.</p>
<p>`</p>
<p>[^1] In General Game Playing (CS227b at Stanford) Genesereth described a game as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lGE-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=strongly+winnable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5sMpBahhGB&amp;sig=ACfU3U2bjzxPaysOKzPlgpAZH2467YNKQA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYtN3K7-3mAhUZHDQIHYeZA4AQ6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=strongly%20winnable&amp;f=false">strongly winnable</a> if and only if for a given role there is a sequence of individual actions of that role that leads to a <code>[win state]</code>.</p>
