		<h1>Made to Stick</h1>
	</header>

	<article>
		<p>An absolutely brilliant book detailing the six major qualities of a sticky idea: Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emetional, Stories. The Heath brothers investigate each of these six qualities in detail, investigating good and bad examples and paring their findings with academic studies. Not quite as academic as <a href="../predictably-irrational">Predictably Irrational</a> but a lot of the same themes show up.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-3-concrete">Chapter 3: Concrete</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Understanding subtraction
<ul>
<li>Schools in Asia generally outperform US</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-4-credible">Chapter 4: Credible</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ulcers are bacterial was a research conclusion that couldn't be sold
<ul>
<li>Researchers were from second tier university and had no credibility</li>
<li>In order to make people believe, had to ingest bacteria themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Antiauthorities
<ul>
<li>Often far more credible than authorities</li>
<li>Think smoker for an anti-smoking campaign</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power of details
<ul>
<li>Stories told with details are more believable</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>People don't remember total numbers but they remember that the number was big</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Human scale &gt; non-human scale

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>NBA orientation had HIV positive women pick up on NBA rookies
<ul>
<li>What's more likely to stick &ndash; telling them about someone getting fooled or getting fooled themselves?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Obvious forms of credibility (external validation and statistics) are not always the best
<ul>
<li>A few vivid details might be more persuasive than statistics</li>
<li>An antiauthority might work better than an authority</li>
<li>A single story that passes the Sinatra Test might overcome a mountain of skepticism.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-5-emotional">Chapter 5: Emotional</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mother Theresa: When it comes to our hearts, one individual trumps the masses.
<ul>
<li>When people provided with both 1 person and the masses, they skew toward response for the masses</li>
<li>When primed to think analytically, they skew toward masses. When primed to think emotionally, skew toward the one. Similar to <a href="../predictably-irrational/">Social vs. Market Norms in Predictably Irrational</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People tend to overuse any idea or concept that delivers an emotional kick.
<ul>
<li>Labeled as &ldquo;Semantic Stretch&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The most basic way to make people care is to form an association between something they don't yet care about and something they do care about.</li>
<li>When everybody taps into the same thing, an arms race emerges</li>
<li>One reliable way of making people care is  by invoking self-interest</li>
<li>&ldquo;People don't buy quarter inch drill bits, they buy quarter-inch holes so they can hang their children's pictures.&rdquo;</li>
<li>WIIFY (What's in it for you) should be a central aspect of every speech.</li>
<li>Imagining things happen make our brains react as though things really happened.</li>
<li>Maslow
<ul>
<li>When people talk about self-interest, they typically invoke the Physical, Security, and Esteem layers.</li>
<li>People invoke Maslow's basement because we believe everyone else is living there while we're in a penthouse.</li>
<li>We believe we are motivated by self-esteem, but others are motivated by down payments.</li>
<li>Job vs. Mission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two ways to reason through value
<ul>
<li>Basic economic value - self interest. Weigh cost and benefits</li>
<li>Second is group interest. Instead of &ldquo;What's in it for me&rdquo; it is &ldquo;What's in it for my group.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Always structuring our ideas around self-interest is like always painting with one color. It's stifling for us and uninspiring for others.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using higher levels of Maslow's hierarchy tends to inspire people more.</li>
<li>Don't mess with Texas
<ul>
<li>Used an identity appeal which worked far better than self-interest appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three strategies for making people care
<ul>
<li>Using associations (or avoiding them)</li>
<li>Appealing to self-interest</li>
<li>Appealing to adentity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Curse of Knowledge can be worked through by continually asking why (Toyota asks 5 Whys)</li>
<li>How do we get people to care?
<ul>
<li>We get them to take off Analytical Hats</li>
<li>We create empathy for specific individuals</li>
<li>We show how our ideas are associated with things that people already care about</li>
<li>We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities; Not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be</li>
<li>Stay clear of Maslow's Basement</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-6-stories">Chapter 6: Stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>A credible idea makes people believe. An emotional idea makes people care. The right stories make people act
<ul>
<li>Nurse in NICU with stethoscope</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>With stories, give people enough information so they could see what they would do
<ul>
<li>Copy machine technicians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The line between a story's audience and a story's protagonist is a bit blurry.
<ul>
<li>When listening to a story, we believe ourselves to be in the story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simulating past events is much more helpful than simulating future outcomes
<ul>
<li>People who focused on how they got into bad situations fare better than people who focus on how they'll get out of them.</li>
<li>The more that training simulates the actions we must take in the world, the more effective it will be. (Flight simulators, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Jared @ Subway
<ul>
<li>This story is not sumuch a flight simulator as a pep talk</li>
<li>Inspiration drives action, as does simulation</li>
<li>Jared far more sticky than &ldquo;7 Under 6&rdquo;, although both are going after same idea at its core</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spotting ideas as powerful (sometimes moreso) than creating</li>
<li>Three basic story plots:
<ul>
<li>Challenge plot inspires us by appealing to our perserverance and courage. Make us want to work harder, take on new challenges, overcome obstacles. <strong>Inspire us to act</strong>
<ul>
<li>Underdog story; rags-to-riches; triumph of willpower over adversity</li>
<li>Star Wars; Jared; American Revolution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connection Plot is a story about people who develop a relationship that bridges a gap. They inspire us in social ways. They make us want to help others, be more tolerant of othrers, work with others, love others.
<ul>
<li>Chicken Soup series</li>
<li>If telling story at company party, go with connection plot, kicking off a project more of a challenge plot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Creativity Plot Involves someone making a mental breakthrough, solving a long-standing puzzle or attacking a problem in an innovative way. They make us want to do something different, to be creative, to experiment with new approaches.
<ul>
<li>Apple on Newton's head; McGyver</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&ldquo;How wonderful, they've stolen my idea. It's become their idea!&rdquo;</li>
<li>Springboard stories
<ul>
<li>If you hit listeners between the eyes with the point directly, they respond by fighting back.</li>
<li>Work in harmony with people acting adversarily</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conference storybook
<ul>
<li>Researcher distilled all stories told at a conference into a book. Presenters were unhappy</li>
<li>Curse of Knowledge - they wanted to conclusions to be written down, but forget that listeners don't have their knowledge.</li>
<li>They remember the experiences that taught them those lessons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hardest part of using stories effectively is making sure that they're Simple.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chapter-7-what-sticks">Chapter 7: What Sticks</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Is the audience's version of my message still core?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>Messages can change (think &ldquo;Elementary, my dear Watson&rdquo; was never spoken by Sherlock)</li>
<li>Ultimately the test of our success as idea creators isn't whether people parrot our words but whether we achieve our goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you can spot a great story you'll always trump a great creator</li>
<li>Villains to speaking &amp; sticking
<ul>
<li>Burying the lead - people like statistics so that can bury the lead</li>
<li>Focus on presentation instead of message - Trying to be charismatic and focus on diction can misconstrue the point</li>
<li>Decision paralysis - Must find the core, but there may be too many things to focus on</li>
<li>Curse of Knowledge - <em>archvillain</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting a message across has two stages
<ul>
<li>Answer - Coming up with the correct answer</li>
<li>Telling others - Harest part because work done in getting to the answer phase will backfire when Telling Others
<ul>
<li>Often we tend to communicate to audience as if they were us</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Communication Framework: Make the audience
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Pay Attention (Unexpected)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Understand and Remember it (Concrete)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3">
<li>Agree / Believe (Credible)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="4">
<li>Care (Emotional)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="5">
<li>Be able to act on it (Story)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>SO: Rather than guess about whether people will understand our ideas, we should ask &ldquo;Is it concrete?&rdquo; Rather than speculate about whether peple will care, we should ask, &ldquo;Is it emotional?&rdquo; Does it get out of Maslow's basement? Does it force people to put on an Analytical Hat or feel empathy?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
