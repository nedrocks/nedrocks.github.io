      <title>Daily Stoicism: Clarify Your Intentions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clarifying my intentions to myself has been one of the strongest changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made over the past few years. I can&amp;rsquo;t say that in every stage and step of life I knew what my end goals are, but I&amp;rsquo;m getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question people like to ask is &amp;ldquo;where do you see yourself in 5 (or 10 or 15) years?&amp;rdquo; My answer five years ago, like most people in their mid-twenties, was probably lacklackluster. I doubt I&amp;rsquo;d have predicted that in five years I&amp;rsquo;d have started a few companies, improved my professional confidence, have a beautiful girlfriend who I plan on marrying, and a stronger understanding of myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I try really hard to remember what I wanted when I was 27, I remember wanting to have a stronger personal life, to have a fulfilling romantic relationship, to win more (where winning wasn&amp;rsquo;t well defined,) and to enjoy my professional life more. I can say with great confidence that I achieved all of those goals, but not because I was striving to those ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I can say that I&amp;rsquo;m very happy with where I am, but going through lots of change where I don&amp;rsquo;t have clear intentions. This day&amp;rsquo;s meditations have made me realize that I need a good framework for what my intentions and goals are. This will guide my actions, help me know if I&amp;rsquo;m on the right track, and let me know when I&amp;rsquo;ve finished.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Stoicism: The Big Three</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/the-big-three/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Control your perceptions,
Direct your actions properly,
Willingly accept what&amp;rsquo;s outside your control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perception, action, and will are the big three. Clearly with these three statements aligned huge improvements are guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the furthest from optimal is my ability to control my perceptions. When I feel things going the wrong way for me, my first reaction is people are acting subversively. For instance, when scheduling an appointment with someone&amp;rsquo;s assistant, I constantly second guess any questions they ask or changes they make. I &lt;em&gt;perceive&lt;/em&gt; the person I&amp;rsquo;m trying to schedule with filtering their shade through the pen of their assistant, when in reality, I&amp;rsquo;m competing against many for a few slots on a calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlling perception comes down to giving full focus to my emotions. So much of what I perceive gets filtered through knee jerk reactions that if I find a way to slow down and actually analyze the emotions that my perceptions will feel more controlled. Perhaps not correct, but controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Stoicism: Be Ruthless to the Things That Don&#39;t Matter</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/be-ruthless-to-things-that-dont-matter/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I reflect on saying no. No to new obligations, to invitations, and to exasperation (through saying no to undesired emotions.) Being able to say no, Seneca reasons, allows us to live more of our life the way we desire to live it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall the first time I learned about the virtues of saying no. I do remember in 2012 answering a job interview question with the virtues of saying no. I suppose I had become so overworked at a prior job that I learned (either through a great teacher or osmosis, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember) that saying no to projects, responsibilities, and social engagements was necessary to maintain my sanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; strong introvert who likes people, I used to wrestle with social invitations. On the one hand, I knew I will enjoy a party but on the other my energy levels are finite and I needed to choose where I spend my social energy. This struggle in college, before I learned how to say no effectively, led to a bimodal existence. I was either socializing and living it up or completely zapped and sleeping 12 or more hours a day to regain my energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today saying no walks a less fine line. Unless I feel very confident that the opportunity presented to me definitely appeals to me then I try to say no. My resolve wavers periodically, but most of the time I am better for it when I stick to my guns.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Stoicism: Education is Freedom</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/education-is-freedom/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 14:03:43 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/education-is-freedom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Epictetus states that only the educated are free. That it’s not enough to say only the free should be educated. Cause and effect — cast off the shackles by learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, learning has driven me. Not necessarily learning via an organized process, but understanding a concept down to the basics. Once I feel I understand, once I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters#Collar&#34;&gt;forged my ring&lt;/a&gt;, I truly own that lesson. Freedom, in my view, is understanding and truly owning all of the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author reminds us to remember that learning grants freedom on the days when we feel distracted. On the days where we choose to waste time instead of read or learn, to remember that it is not what we have learned that allows us freedom but the act of continual study that grants it to us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Stoicism: Control and Choice</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/control-and-choice/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 14:01:34 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/control-and-choice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Epictetus asks rhetorically where to do we look for good and evil? Within the externals that we have no control over or the choices that we control. Obviously things that we have no control over should not affect our happiness or outlook and yet so often we look at these externals as reflections of who we are, or some outcome of choices that we made. When we missed our connect flight by 2 minutes due to a delay I yelled my head off and acted really salty to the women at the gate, but it had no affect on the situation other than darkening my outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AA uses the serenity prayer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
Courage to change the things I can,
And wisdom to know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I am not an alcoholic, nor in AA, nor believe in god, the premise is spot on. In fact, knowing the difference is the first part I will tackle. It’s so easy to get wrapped up in things that I cannot control that in a lot of cases I can’t discern what I can’t control vs what I can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Stoicism January: Clarity</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/clarity/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2017 13:55:40 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/2017/1/clarity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The month’s focus is clarity. My initial reflections on clarity bring me back to an online RPG I played as a teenager called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest&#34;&gt;Everquest&lt;/a&gt; where in order to recover mana you had to just sit there. In fact, before you reached level 35 you had to sit there and stare at your spell book. The clarity spell cast by the enchanter class would speed up mana recovery significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reflect more on the concept of clarity outside the realm of video games, I think of those fleeting glimpses of the world where all of my emotions express themselves in harmony. Suddenly everything becomes clear and my correct and optimal path shows itself. A brief moment of clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarity in the engineering world has been far simpler to achieve. The path of implementation for a new product, concept, or test discovers me a lot of the time. Even when there’s a problem that does not lend an easy solution, I can see how to tackle it by breaking it down into components or sub problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to going through this month, I think that clarity is like being in the zone. When I&amp;rsquo;m there, things move more slowly so I can solve problems quicker. When I’m there I can feel every muscle in my body working for me. When I’m there I understand things without needing to focus on them. When I’m there, things seem to happen effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go into this month with my eyes open and ready to meditate on thirty one concepts around clarity. New year, new goals and I look forward to learning and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily Stoicism Meditations</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/background/</link>

      <guid>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/daily-stoic/background/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve begun going through the 366 daily stoic meditations provided by (The Daily Stoic)[&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736&lt;/a&gt;]. I decided that there&amp;rsquo;s no better way to distill my knowledge and share it with others than putting it in a daily update. I will likely falter and miss updating some days, but look forward to reading my musings on a few hundred meditations on Stoicism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello, World!</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/hello-world/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had &amp;ldquo;Make a personal website&amp;rdquo; on my todo list for about 5 years now. It always seemed daunting. At the end of the day, I continued to let the perfect be the enemy of the good and thus never pulled the trigger on it. But here we are, a reasonable website that&amp;rsquo;s not great, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy with the first step. As a goal for 2017, I plan to add my book reviews here, and attempt to write a blog post four times per month. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, happy 2017!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/books/positioning/</link>

      <guid>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/books/positioning/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586&#34;&gt;Positioning&lt;/a&gt; is a short read from the 1980s that speaks to marketing in an overcommunicated society. Clearly more relevant today than ever, Al Ries addresses the phenomenon of being second to market in a competitive field. The case studies in the last 5 chapters help drive home the points. Strong introduction to market and product positioning. &lt;em&gt;7 / 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
