      <description>Black Lives Matter This is true, categorically and unequivocally. I stand with all black and brown people for equality. If you take nothing else from this post, please take away the truth that Black Lives Matter.
If you agree with this and have white privilege by merely existing, then this is a call to action for you. It&amp;rsquo;s long-winded because I&amp;rsquo;m filled with emotion and a bit of wine, but I sincerely hope you see this as a starting point to be an ally.</description>
