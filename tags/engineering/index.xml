      <description>(If you just want to look at the code, check it out on my github. Leave a comment if you want to chat about it!)
I believe that services in golang should abstract errors between their internal package and their api package. I find this makes managing errors and logic flows much more manageable, with one exception. There needs to exist a layer to convert an internal error into its API representation.</description>

      <description>I have been lucky to have interview training from small companies, large companies, and external consultants. I&amp;rsquo;ve practiced my skills while conducting at least 750 interviews over my career. I&amp;rsquo;d go so far as to call myself a well-trained interviewer.
In case you&amp;rsquo;ve never been part of a technical interview, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a quick rundown. The candidate&amp;rsquo;s interview usually lasts between three to eight hours, with each interview taking between 30 minutes and one hour.</description>

      <description>One year ago I made a major career change. I transitioned from an engineering director position managing a team of 18 engineers and three managers to an individual contributor senior engineer.
Honestly, I struggled initially while deciding on the transition. It felt like my career would backslide with the change. On one hand, I had fought hard and succeeded to reach the director level and I enjoyed my team - in fact, I had hired almost half of them myself.</description>
