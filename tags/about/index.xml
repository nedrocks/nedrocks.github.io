      <description>I&#39;m a San Francisco Bay Area native. I grew up in Palo Alto, went to school at Stanford to study Computer Science and now live in SF.
By Day I&#39;m a problem solver. Usually this means working with others to build things using computers. I&#39;ve been a professional software engineer since 2007, a product manager since 2013, and an entrepreneur since 2014. I may be the most passionate person you&#39;ll ever work with.</description>
