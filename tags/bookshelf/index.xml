      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely fantastic book. I forgot to write a review for it initially and now (6 months later) I finally am getting back to it. I can say that over the past 6 months, this is the book I&amp;rsquo;ve referenced the most (save for &amp;ldquo;A Song of Ice and Fire series&amp;rdquo; due to Game of Thrones&amp;rsquo; penultimate season) and couldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1-high-tech-marketing-illusion&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: High-Tech Marketing Illusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In academic terms, such change sensitive products are called &amp;ldquo;discontinuous&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;disruptive innovations&amp;rdquo;. The contrasting term &amp;ldquo;continuous&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;sustaining innovations&amp;rdquo;, revers to the normal upgrading of products that does not require us to change behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warby Parker promises you better looking eyeglasses, that is continuous innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherhand, Samsung 3-D TV would be discontinuous integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Between &amp;ldquo;continuous&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;discontinuous&amp;rdquo; lies a sepctrum of demands for behavioral change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funny/Surprising: Initial research in this research was based on adoption of new strains of potatoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovators&lt;/strong&gt; pursue new technology products aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Adopters&lt;/strong&gt; buy into new produt concepts very early but they are not technologists

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are core to opening up any high-tech market segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Majority&lt;/strong&gt; share some of the early adopter&amp;rsquo;s ability to relate to technology, but ultimately they are driven by a strong sense of practicality

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand most innovations are passing fads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Late majority&lt;/strong&gt; like early majority but are not comfortable with technology at all.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also not willing to pay for premium; wait for R&amp;amp;D costs to be fully amortized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laggards&lt;/strong&gt; The only time they buy new tech is when it&amp;rsquo;s buried within another product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to maintain momentum in order to create a bandwagon effect that makes it natural for next group to want to buy in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Important to show the new technology enables some strategic leap forward, perhaps through some compelling flagship application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early majority is willing to become technologically competent where necessary while late majority is not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early adopter is buying a change agent where they can get a jump on the competition

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They expect a radical discontinuity between old ways and new&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being the first they will deal with bugs and glitches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early majority want to buy a productivity imporvement for existing operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early adopters &lt;strong&gt;do not&lt;/strong&gt; make a good reference for early majority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is something fundamentally different between a sale to an early adopter and a sale to the early majority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2-high-tech-marketing-enlightenment&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: High-Tech Marketing Enlightenment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we find in the concept of marketing a reasonable basis for taking actions that will predictably and positively affect company revenues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High tech market definition contains:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A set of actual or potential customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a given set of products or services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who have a common set of needs or wants, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who reference each other when making a buying decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Innovators: Technology Enthusiasts

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology enthusiasts are teh gatekeepers for any new technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want the truth without any tricks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want access to the most technically knowledgeable person to answer it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They want to be the first to get the new stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They think all technology should be free or available at cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct response advertising works well with this group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t waste your money on a lot of fancy image advertising&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not powerful enough to dictate the buying decisions of others; Do not represent a significant market in themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kindling to start the fire&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early Adopters: The visionaries

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know it takes a quantum leap forward in how business is conducted in their industry or by their customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They see a potential for an order-of-magnitude ROI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visionaries are easy to sell to but hard to please&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things require quick changes so it&amp;rsquo;s important to build in milestones that lend themselves to this sort of product spin-off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamics of early markets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Winning at marketing requires being the biggest fish in the pond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pursue a &amp;ldquo;bowling pin strategy&amp;rdquo; where knocking one over will help knock others over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem: Must sell the visionary before having the product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem: Marketing falls prey to the crack between the technology enthusiast and the visionary by failing to discovery the compelling application that provides the order-of-magnitude leap in benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early Majority: The pragmatists

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who do not assert a position in life so much as derive one from what life provides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the goal of visionaries is to take a quantum leap forward, the goal of pragmatists is to make a percentage improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The word risk is negative in their vocabulary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is very tough to break into a new industry selling to pragmatists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Late majority: The conservatives

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a marketable segment, they are rarely developed as profitably as they could be, largely because high-tech companies are not, as a rule, in sympathy with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have more in common with early adopters than you&amp;rsquo;d think - both can be stubborn in their resistance to the call to conform that unites the pragmatist herd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an example, old cell phones that were built for single functionality (email, video, games) were good for them and one that did it all they did not like and feared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are price sensitive because they cannot get the full value from their experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dynamics of mainstream markets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importance of the product itself, its unique functionality is most important to early markets and least to mainstream markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laggards: The skeptics

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Struggling to point out: new systems don&amp;rsquo;t deliver on the promise made at the time of purchase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service that skeptics provide to high-tech moarketers is to point continually to the discrepancies between the sales claims and the delivered product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are made up of people who reference each other during buying decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four fundamental characteristics of visionaries alienate pragmatists

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visionaries lack respect for the value of colleagues&amp;rsquo; experiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visionaries take a greater interest in tech than in their industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visionaries fail to acknowledge the importance of existing product infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visionaries have little self-awareness about th eimpact of their disruptiveness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visionaries stay a step ahead of disaster by getting out of town while they can and leave pragmatists to clean up the mess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies want pragmatists to buy today while pragmatists want to wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-3-the-d-day-analogy&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: The D-Day Analogy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perils of the chasm

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managers would like to retreat into their existing major-account relationships, service them in an exceptional way, and leverage that investment of an additional year in fleshing out the greater part of the visionary&amp;rsquo;s plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While there is plenty of good work to do, there is no additional money to pay for it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fighting your way into the mainstream

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are an invader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The efficiency of the marketing process, is a function of the &amp;ldquo;boundedness&amp;rdquo; of the market segment being addressed

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More tightly bound, the easier it is to introduce messages into it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most companies fail to cross because they are overwhelmed with size of mainstream market causing them to lose their focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to start a fire

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consequences of being sales-driven during the chasm period are fatal. (one must be market driven)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;secure a beachhead in a mainstream market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a strong word-of-mouth reputation among buyers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mass of informed individuals who meet from time to time and reinforce the product&amp;rsquo;s or the company&amp;rsquo;s positioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pragmatists want to buy from market leaders

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They wait until one has been decided (which further amplifies the chasm effect)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big fish, small pond strategy by segmenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When crossing the chasm, focus on one or two very tightly defined market segments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salesforce

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First and foremost to help the salespeople themselves by giving their managers direct visibility into their pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salesforce was a true productivity tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lesson: find a beachhead segment that is:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Big enough to matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small enough to win&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good fit with your crown jewels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-4-target-the-point-of-attack&#34;&gt;Chapter 4: Target the Point of Attack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A High-Risk, Low-Data Decision

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest mistake one can make in this state is to turn to numeric information as a source of refuge or reassurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It will be a billion-dollar market in 2016. If we only get five percent of that market&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informed intuition rather than analytical reason is the most trustworthy decision-making tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Informed Intuition

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only work with memorable images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target Customer Characterization: The Use of Scenarios

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The place where most crossing-the-chasm marketing segmentation efforts get into trouble is at the beginning, when they focus on a target market or a target segment instead of a target customer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-5-assemble-the-invasion-force&#34;&gt;Chapter 5: Assemble the Invasion Force&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a given target customer and a given application, create a marketplace in which your product is the only reasonable buying proposition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a gap between the marketing promise made to the customer and the ability of the shipped product to fulfill that promise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But, as marketplaces develop, as we enter the &lt;em&gt;mainstream market&lt;/em&gt;, products in the center become more and more alike, and the battle shifts increasingly to the outer circles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The pragmatist consumers want the product to be available from the outset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the pragmatists are offered a great deal on an alternative suite of products (e.g. Google Apps) they fre some part of the whole product will be missing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In every case, there is a risk that they are preferring an inferior product if you look at the generic product, but in every case they are preferring the superior product if you look at the whole product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pragmatists evaluate and buy whole products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole Product Planning

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest difference is early market will piece together a whole product in return for getting a jump on the competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretending you are winning the whole product battle is a losing tactic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By leaving customer success to chance you are giving up control over your own destiny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By thinking through customer&amp;rsquo;s problems and solutions in their entirety you can define and work to ensure that the customer gets the whole product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you are crossing the chasm, there is no hope of any external support that is not specifically recruited by you for this purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partners and Allies

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;whole product&amp;rdquo; alliances have one purpose: Accelerate the formation of whole product infrastructure within a specific target market segment in support of a segment-specific compelling reason to buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any company that executes a whole product strategry competently has a high probability of mainstream market success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recap: Tips on Whole Product Management

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With large partners, try to work from the bottom up, with small ones from the top down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnerships ultimately work only when specific individuals from the different companies involved choose to trust each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;chapter-6-define-the-battle&#34;&gt;Chapter 6: Define the Battle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand who or what the competition is, what their current relationship to our target customer consists of, and how we can best position ourselves to drive them out of our target market segment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fundamental rule of engagement is that any force can defeat any other force - if it can define the battle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create competition where non exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating the competition

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where there is no competition, there is no market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competition takes place at the level of corporate agenda, not at the level of competing products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the pragmatists domain, competition is defined by comparative evaluations of products and vendors within a common category&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In sum, the pragmatists are loath to buy until they can compare&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focus in on the values and concerns of the pragmatists, not the visionaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The competitive positioning compass

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who are supportive of your value proposition take an interest in your products and in your company. People who are skeptical do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more they appreciate the technology the easier it becomes for them to support the product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You develop an early market by demonstrating a strong technology advantage and converting it to product credibility, and you develop a mainstream market leadership advantage and converting it to company credibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we must shift our marketing focus from celebrating product-centric value attributes to market-centric ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product-Centric:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cool Product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elegant architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market-Centric

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most complete whole product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solid user experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility with standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situational value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fit for purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To sum up, it is the market-centric value system - supplemented (but not superseded) by the product-centric one - that must be the basis for the value profile of the target customers when crossing the chasm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market alternative that user has been buying from for years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competitor is the market alternative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our intent is to acknowledge their technology but to differentiate from them by virtue of our own segment-specific focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you try out this exercise of choosing the competition and have trouble finding either a single, clear market alternative, or a credible second vendor leveraging your type of disruptive technology, this is a clue. It means you are probably not ready to cross the chasm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioning

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When most people think of positioning they are thinking about how to make their products easier to sell. But the correct goal is to make it easier to buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By focusing on making a product easy to buy, you are focusing on what the customers really want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The goal of positioning, therefore, is to create a space inside the target customer&amp;rsquo;s head called &amp;ldquo;best buy for this type of situation&amp;rdquo; and to attain sole, undisputed occupancy of that space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential customers cannot buy what they cannot name, nor can they seek out the product unless they know what category to look under.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers will not buy something until they know who is going to use it and for what purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers cannot know what to expect or what to pay for a product until they can place it in some sort of comparative context&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customers cannot be completely secure in buying a product until they know it comes from a vendor with staying power who will continue to invest in this product category. This is the final extension of positioning needed to make a product easy to buy for a conservative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most failed positioning statements arise from vendors being unable to see themselves from someone else&amp;rsquo;s point of view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Claim: Passing the Elevator Test

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whatever your claim is, it cannot be transmitted by word of mouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A product with an uncertain position is very difficult to buy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to recruit partners and allies, because they won&amp;rsquo;t be sure enough about your goals to make any meaningful commitments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For (target customers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who are disasatisfied with (current market alternative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;our product is a (product category)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That provides (compelling reason to buy)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlike (the product alternative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have assembled (key whole product features for your specific application)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shifting burden of truth

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most powerful evidence of leadership and likelihood of competitive victory is market share. In the absence of definitive numbers here, pragmatists will look to the quality and number of partners and allies you have assembled in your camp, and their degree of demonstrable commitment to your cause.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whole Product Launches

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The message that will resonate now is much more likely to be &amp;ldquo;Look at this hot new market&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pragmatists and conservatives - the core of any mainstream market - like to do business with people they know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-7-launch-the-invasion&#34;&gt;Chapter 7: Launch the Invasion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number-one corporate objective, when crossing the chasm, is to secure a distribution channel into the mainstream market, one with which the pragmatist customer will be comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer-Oriented Distribution

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The marketing involved is called relationship marketing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The normal approach is called solution selling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provocation-based selling, in which the vendor makes the provocative claim that the customer should redirect existing budget, typically to meet a heretofore unnoticed opportunity or impending crisis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing on the Web is primarily promotional marketing, often driven by a free offer or trial period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the user clicks on a link, the state of the relationship changes to a direct response sales strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Made to Stick</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/books/made-to-stick/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 12:52:46 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/books/made-to-stick/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;An absolutely brilliant book detailing the six major qualities of a sticky idea: Simplicity, Unexpectedness, Concreteness, Credibility, Emetional, Stories. The Heath brothers investigate each of these six qualities in detail, investigating good and bad examples and paring their findings with academic studies. Not quite as academic as &lt;a href=&#34;../predictably-irrational&#34;&gt;Predictably Irrational&lt;/a&gt; but a lot of the same themes show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1-simple&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: Simple&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick to the prime objective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southwest airlines is &lt;strong&gt;THE&lt;/strong&gt; low-fare airline

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answers questions all the way down the org chart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burying the lead

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;News should start with most important info and then decrease in importance down the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burying the lead happens when most important points slip down the page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you say 3 things, you don&amp;rsquo;t say anything

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bill Clinton (1992) campaign must have one platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the economy, stupid!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision paralysis

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When given more &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; options, the vital one stands out

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out when all options are equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to prioritization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names, names, names

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local newspaper about names, even at financial expense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share message so it can percolate through org chart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple = core + compact

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sound bites, but &lt;strong&gt;proverbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse of Knowledge

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficult to imagine not knowing information you already know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual proverb was palm pilot &amp;ndash; creator carried it around in his pocket and used it to help guide product decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pomelo schema

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easier to remember &amp;ldquo;like a grapefruit&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;citrus based fruit with some properties&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complexity from simplicity

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fine line between accuracy and simplicity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think Bohr model of atom when talking to child &amp;ndash; not accurate completely, but simple and easy to digest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schemas in Hollywood =&amp;gt; Speed is Die Hard on a bus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generative analogies

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disneyland employs cast members instead of employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doesn&amp;rsquo;t always work &amp;ndash; think sandwich artists at Subway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2-unexpected&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: Unexpected&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprise gets attention; interest keeps attention

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid gimmickry (wolves attack marching band in a commercial; what were they advertising?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find core of idea: What&amp;rsquo;s surprising?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People have inherent guessing machines. Try and break their guessing machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tire chains at Nordstrom&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core: Great customer service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprise: Nordies (employees) will take back things they don&amp;rsquo;t even sell!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Journalism

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find hidden sticky points within the facts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The lead is there won&amp;rsquo;t be school on Thursday!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping attention

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show people that they have gaps in their knowledge and then fill them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show people enough information such that they have gaps &amp;ndash; think NCAA football about schools we don&amp;rsquo;t care about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-3-concrete&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: Concrete&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fox and sour grapes: concreteness of story keeps it stuck

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fables in general are very concrete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Nature Conservancy tried to get donors using abstract donate to save important land

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard for people to donate to arbitrary land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once a name is attached to un-interesting land (think Silicon Valley watershed) such as The Mount Hamilton Wilderness, people want to support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding subtraction

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schools in Asia generally outperform US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely because they use concrete terms such as people, things, etc (think # of apples in a subtraction problem) while in US we skew abstract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concrete is memorable =&amp;gt; Concrete accounting class led people to remember more than abstract&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velcro theory =&amp;gt; more hooks, stronger grab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brown eyes vs. Blue eyes to teach about discrimination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blueprint vs. machine

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers make things continually more abstract while machine workers can&amp;rsquo;t fully grok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since both understand machine, should try to speak in same vernacular (machines)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowest common denominator language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concrete goals lead to better coordination

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not &amp;ldquo;best in world&amp;rdquo;, but &amp;ldquo;X that can do Y, Z, A&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go computers =&amp;gt; concrete pitch to VCs that had others arguing instead of entrepreneur pitching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-4-credible&#34;&gt;Chapter 4: Credible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ulcers are bacterial was a research conclusion that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be sold

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers were from second tier university and had no credibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to make people believe, had to ingest bacteria themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antiauthorities

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often far more credible than authorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think smoker for an anti-smoking campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power of details

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stories told with details are more believable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationships are better than numbers (BBs in a bucket for warheads)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t remember total numbers but they remember that the number was big&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human scale &amp;gt; non-human scale

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to imagine distance from sun to Earth, but from NY -&amp;gt; LA is at least visualizable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistics are very credible, but often are forgotten&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shark attack vs. deers in the road

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People afraid of sharks, but it turns out not many kill humans. More likely to die from hitting a deer in the road.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sinatra test - &amp;ldquo;If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere&amp;rdquo;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there versions of this to use for credibility?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safexpress delivered Harry Potter book &amp;ndash; passed Sinatra test to handle precious cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal Credibility - &lt;strong&gt;Details&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Statistics&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Sinatra Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;External Credibility - Authorities, antiauthorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audience Credibility - Try it yourself; Falsifiable claim

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testable credentials allows people to try out an idea for themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NBA orientation had HIV positive women pick up on NBA rookies

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s more likely to stick &amp;ndash; telling them about someone getting fooled or getting fooled themselves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obvious forms of credibility (external validation and statistics) are not always the best

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few vivid details might be more persuasive than statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An antiauthority might work better than an authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A single story that passes the Sinatra Test might overcome a mountain of skepticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-5-emotional&#34;&gt;Chapter 5: Emotional&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mother Theresa: When it comes to our hearts, one individual trumps the masses.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people provided with both 1 person and the masses, they skew toward response for the masses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When primed to think analytically, they skew toward masses. When primed to think emotionally, skew toward the one. Similar to &lt;a href=&#34;../predictably-irrational/&#34;&gt;Social vs. Market Norms in Predictably Irrational&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People tend to overuse any idea or concept that delivers an emotional kick.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labeled as &amp;ldquo;Semantic Stretch&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most basic way to make people care is to form an association between something they don&amp;rsquo;t yet care about and something they do care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When everybody taps into the same thing, an arms race emerges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One reliable way of making people care is  by invoking self-interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;People don&amp;rsquo;t buy quarter inch drill bits, they buy quarter-inch holes so they can hang their children&amp;rsquo;s pictures.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WIIFY (What&amp;rsquo;s in it for you) should be a central aspect of every speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imagining things happen make our brains react as though things really happened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maslow

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people talk about self-interest, they typically invoke the Physical, Security, and Esteem layers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People invoke Maslow&amp;rsquo;s basement because we believe everyone else is living there while we&amp;rsquo;re in a penthouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We believe we are motivated by self-esteem, but others are motivated by down payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job vs. Mission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two ways to reason through value

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic economic value - self interest. Weigh cost and benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second is group interest. Instead of &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s in it for me&amp;rdquo; it is &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s in it for my group.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Always structuring our ideas around self-interest is like always painting with one color. It&amp;rsquo;s stifling for us and uninspiring for others.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using higher levels of Maslow&amp;rsquo;s hierarchy tends to inspire people more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t mess with Texas

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used an identity appeal which worked far better than self-interest appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three strategies for making people care

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using associations (or avoiding them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appealing to self-interest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appealing to adentity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse of Knowledge can be worked through by continually asking why (Toyota asks 5 Whys)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we get people to care?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get them to take off Analytical Hats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We create empathy for specific individuals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We show how our ideas are associated with things that people already care about&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We appeal to their self-interest, but we also appeal to their identities; Not only to the people they are right now but also to the people they would like to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay clear of Maslow&amp;rsquo;s Basement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-6-stories&#34;&gt;Chapter 6: Stories&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A credible idea makes people believe. An emotional idea makes people care. The right stories make people act

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nurse in NICU with stethoscope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With stories, give people enough information so they could see what they would do

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy machine technicians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The line between a story&amp;rsquo;s audience and a story&amp;rsquo;s protagonist is a bit blurry.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When listening to a story, we believe ourselves to be in the story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulating past events is much more helpful than simulating future outcomes

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who focused on how they got into bad situations fare better than people who focus on how they&amp;rsquo;ll get out of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more that training simulates the actions we must take in the world, the more effective it will be. (Flight simulators, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jared @ Subway

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This story is not sumuch a flight simulator as a pep talk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspiration drives action, as does simulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jared far more sticky than &amp;ldquo;7 Under 6&amp;rdquo;, although both are going after same idea at its core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotting ideas as powerful (sometimes moreso) than creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three basic story plots:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenge plot inspires us by appealing to our perserverance and courage. Make us want to work harder, take on new challenges, overcome obstacles. &lt;strong&gt;Inspire us to act&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underdog story; rags-to-riches; triumph of willpower over adversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Star Wars; Jared; American Revolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connection Plot is a story about people who develop a relationship that bridges a gap. They inspire us in social ways. They make us want to help others, be more tolerant of othrers, work with others, love others.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken Soup series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If telling story at company party, go with connection plot, kicking off a project more of a challenge plot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creativity Plot Involves someone making a mental breakthrough, solving a long-standing puzzle or attacking a problem in an innovative way. They make us want to do something different, to be creative, to experiment with new approaches.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple on Newton&amp;rsquo;s head; McGyver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;How wonderful, they&amp;rsquo;ve stolen my idea. It&amp;rsquo;s become their idea!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Springboard stories

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you hit listeners between the eyes with the point directly, they respond by fighting back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work in harmony with people acting adversarily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference storybook

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researcher distilled all stories told at a conference into a book. Presenters were unhappy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse of Knowledge - they wanted to conclusions to be written down, but forget that listeners don&amp;rsquo;t have their knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They remember the experiences that taught them those lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardest part of using stories effectively is making sure that they&amp;rsquo;re Simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-7-what-sticks&#34;&gt;Chapter 7: What Sticks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is the audience&amp;rsquo;s version of my message still core?&amp;rdquo;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Messages can change (think &amp;ldquo;Elementary, my dear Watson&amp;rdquo; was never spoken by Sherlock)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultimately the test of our success as idea creators isn&amp;rsquo;t whether people parrot our words but whether we achieve our goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can spot a great story you&amp;rsquo;ll always trump a great creator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Villains to speaking &amp;amp; sticking

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burying the lead - people like statistics so that can bury the lead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on presentation instead of message - Trying to be charismatic and focus on diction can misconstrue the point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision paralysis - Must find the core, but there may be too many things to focus on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curse of Knowledge - &lt;em&gt;archvillain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting a message across has two stages

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer - Coming up with the correct answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telling others - Harest part because work done in getting to the answer phase will backfire when Telling Others

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often we tend to communicate to audience as if they were us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication Framework: Make the audience

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1. Pay Attention (Unexpected)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2. Understand and Remember it (Concrete)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3. Agree / Believe (Credible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4. Care (Emotional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5. Be able to act on it (Story)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SO: Rather than guess about whether people will understand our ideas, we should ask &amp;ldquo;Is it concrete?&amp;rdquo; Rather than speculate about whether peple will care, we should ask, &amp;ldquo;Is it emotional?&amp;rdquo; Does it get out of Maslow&amp;rsquo;s basement? Does it force people to put on an Analytical Hat or feel empathy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Predictably Irrational</title>
      <link>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/books/predictably-irrational/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2017 09:26:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.nedrockson.com/post/books/predictably-irrational/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Overall a fantastic book detailing human behavior from a psychological and economic point of view. My favorite chapter was Cost of Social Norms, as it opened my eyes to a new point of view on interactions in a professional context. Dan Ariely does an amazing job detailing caveats of human irrationality throughout the book and I would say a must read for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-truth-about-relativity&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Truth About Relativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objectivity is nearly impossible

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how much is something actually worth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People make relative decisions on worth.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They like the better of some options but not the best&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think bread makers - when they don&amp;rsquo;t sell because they are new, introduce a second, more expensive bread maker and the cheaper one will sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-2-the-fallacy-of-supply-demand&#34;&gt;Chapter 2: The Fallacy of Supply &amp;amp; Demand&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demand can be manufactured

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black pearls made in high demand simply by positioning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anchoring - the first price you hear foro a product or category tends to stick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starbucks

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positioned itself differently to remove Dunkin Donuts&amp;rsquo; price anchor for coffee (why should I pay $4 for a cup of coffee?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you go a few times, your decision making for going again is akin to seeing a line out the front door (it&amp;rsquo;s clearly popular because I&amp;rsquo;ve been.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Sawyer showed a low supply product (painting fence) and raised demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if we are the sum of our first, naïve, myopic decisions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually question our decisions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much benefit does something actually bring?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices can influence willingness to pay

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demand is not entirely separate from supply&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People like to make well thought out decisions but want to arrive at a, probably, preconceived conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-3-cost-of-zero-cost&#34;&gt;Chapter 3: Cost of Zero Cost&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Zero!&lt;/code&gt; is a powerful marketing tactic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laws of demand tend to break down with &lt;code&gt;Zero!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So powerful, sometimes (or often) makes consumers miscalculate outcomes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All transactions have upside and downside. Free has no downside with some guaranteed upside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMZN shipping for free vs $.20

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massive difference in spending when free, even though 20 cents (1 Franc) was next to nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero calories vs. 1 calorie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paying for dinner

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each incremental dollar paid is less pain (diminishing sensitivity) and thus it&amp;rsquo;s always better for one person to pay the whole bill instead of split.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-4-the-cost-of-social-norms&#34;&gt;Chapter 4: The Cost of Social Norms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social norms vs. market norms

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social much stronger but they cannot be mixed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once market norms are brought in, social norms will likely not return&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do work as favor is okay &amp;amp; fair wage okay, but for small $ amount won&amp;rsquo;t work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gifts work, but not when a price tag is attached&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When price tag attached, gifts just the same as market norms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doing tasks after having heard sentences like &amp;ldquo;High paying salary&amp;rdquo; lead people to be more market minded &amp;amp; less social (compared to phrases like &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s cold outside&amp;rdquo;)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for help less&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less likely to offer help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus&lt;/strong&gt; even mentioning prices move us into market norms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking up kids @ daycare: social vs $ penalty

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once reversed from social -&amp;gt; market -&amp;gt; social, the parental behavior didn&amp;rsquo;t change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social norm goes away for a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gifts vs. Cash bonuses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Police &amp;amp; firefighters vs. border / customs agents&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All social norms go out the window b/c of huge savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cookies from coworker

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When free, I&amp;rsquo;ll consider hunger, calories, love of cookies, social pressures of taking too many.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When they cost $0.05 I won&amp;rsquo;t consider social norms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starburst experiment

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$0.01 per candy obeys demand laws&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free people take FEWER! (odd because doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow rational market economics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When price is not part of exchange, we become less selfish maximizers &amp;amp; care about welfare of others

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last sushi piece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Effort is somewhere between market and social norms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carbon taxes skews the line because it may increase carbon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When emotions are piqued it&amp;rsquo;s hard to take others emotions into account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-6-influence-of-arrousal&#34;&gt;Chapter 6: Influence of Arrousal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When aroused, choices are different than when not

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to predict behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe true for other emotions as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Credit usually defaults or becomes expensive due to procrastination&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parental voice causes us to pay attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precommitting to healthcare (e.g. refunded deposit to get cholesterol checked) may help us actually get it done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ford cars needed checkups, but differed per model

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made the 5,000; 10,000; 25,000 mile checkups

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect mix of authoritative &amp;amp; self imposed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initially a tough sell internally b/c mustang is different from F-150&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Duke basketball tickets

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People stand inline for a long long time to join a lottery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who get tix value the tickets really high because of an emotional response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those who don&amp;rsquo;t value them really low because they see the monetary value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference is large ($2400 vs. $175)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fall in ove with what we already have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We focus on what we may lose instead of gain (when selling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assume others will see transaction from our perspective&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual ownership

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think long running eBay auctions (like I already own it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrading for free for a limited time (downgrade rarely happens)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving from ownership to pre ownership feels like a loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-9-keeping-doors-open&#34;&gt;Chapter 9: Keeping Doors Open&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We work hard to keep doors open

&lt;li&gt;Buy bless and whistles just in case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picking majors in school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximizing profit while clicking (game, experiment)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People always try to keep doors open even if those doors don&amp;rsquo;t maximize profit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sad side are when we don&amp;rsquo;t realize there are slowly closing doors

&lt;li&gt;Kids growing up&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Beer test with adding balsamic vinegar

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not told, peple prefer balsamic to crappy beer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If told about vinegar before, people hate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If told about afterward, people like it as much as if never told&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expectations drive results

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joshua Bell in subway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do settings really matter (probably)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Names on menus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pepsi Challenge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expectations &amp;amp; stereotypes

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asians good at math, women bad at math; When Asian women asked to do math, it depended on precondition &amp;ndash; were they thinking about their cultural background or gender background before?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alexander Pope: Blessed is he who expects nothing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-11-the-power-of-price&#34;&gt;Chapter 11: The Power of Price&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placebo surgeries can sometimes prove the surgery has not added benefit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A more expensive medication (even if medication is a placebo) has a stronger effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a placebo is primed (SoBe causes better test taking) the higher price still has a stronger effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divine touch from kings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physicians prescribe placebos a lot (antibiotic placebos for viral infections)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are placebos good or bad?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W/o using placebos we can&amp;rsquo;t improve or test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;W/ placebos people may die now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airborne was placebo that worked (but ended up being screwed up by warnings on the packaging.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-12-the-cycle-of-distrust&#34;&gt;Chapter 12: The Cycle of Distrust&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam email; fine print; marketing ploys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free money experiment

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving away free money (printed on sign how much)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only 1% of people walking by stopped for $1, only 19% for $50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All believed there was a catch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tragedy of the commons &amp;amp; game theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snake oil salesmen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lying on dating sites &amp;ndash; You&amp;rsquo;re expected to lie so when you don&amp;rsquo;t it&amp;rsquo;s bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;True statements when &amp;ldquo;endorsed&amp;rdquo; by companies (DNC, RNC, P&amp;amp;G) breed mistrust

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same statements w/o endorsements do not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening to speakers with brochure vs consumer reports &amp;ndash; people tended to think the speakers were better with consumer report instead of brochure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency is rare for a company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-13-the-context-of-our-character-part-1&#34;&gt;Chapter 13: The Context of Our Character, Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People steal, a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between robbing &amp;amp; white collar crime

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think over deducting on taxes vs. bank robbery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiments tempting people to cheat

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When tempted, people cheat a little, but could do a lot more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When asked to remember 10 commandments, no cheating!

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if they didn&amp;rsquo;t know more than a couple of them &amp;ndash; just the thought of a code of laws was enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems superego keeps people from cheating egregiously

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheating a little does not activate superego&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Problem is some cheat a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could professional oaths help solve issue?

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Degradation of proffesions with oaths (doctors, lawyers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seems people are tempted to cheat for personal gains (Tragedy of Commons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking people to sign a non-existant honor code stopped cheating

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thus, just thinking about existence of a code stops people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-14-the-context-of-our-character-part-2&#34;&gt;Chapter 14: The Context of Our Character, Part 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dollar bills make people more honest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removing direct link to money (coca cola in fridge) makes people less so&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would Enron guys have robbed from old ladies? (no) but they took money from them indirectly from pension funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment: Give tokens worth $.50 that could be exchanged 12 feet away vs giving $.50 directly. Way more cheating in former case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cheating when reporting losses, wardrobing, expense reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human nature can cause people to be dishonest when not directly connected with $$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequent flyer miles BS with airlines; Credit card companies

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentially robbery, but not directly so feels more okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens when we no longer use cash directly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-15-beer-free-lunches&#34;&gt;Chapter 15: Beer &amp;amp; Free Lunches&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People try to make unique orders (in our culture, not necessarily in others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best utility when ordering is to order first, or at least say your desire out load to get &amp;ldquo;dibs&amp;rdquo; on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free lunches shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exist because they should be eaten already&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Positioning-Battle-Your-Al-Ries/dp/0071373586&#34;&gt;Positioning&lt;/a&gt; is a short read from the 1980s that speaks to marketing in an overcommunicated society. Clearly more relevant today than ever, Al Ries addresses the phenomenon of being second to market in a competitive field. The case studies in the last 5 chapters help drive home the points. Strong introduction to market and product positioning. &lt;em&gt;7 / 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
